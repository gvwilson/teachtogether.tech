\chaplbl{Actionable Approximations of the Truth}{s:pck}

Every instructor needs three things:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \gref{g:content-knowledge}{content knowledge}, such as how to
  program;
\item
  \gref{g:general-pedagogical-knowledge}{general pedagogical knowledge},
  such as an understanding of the psychology of learning; and
\item
  \gref{g:pedagogical-content-knowledge}{pedagogical content knowledge}
  (PCK), which is the domain-specific knowledge of how to teach a
  particular concept to a particular audience.
\end{itemize}

In computing, PCK includes things like what examples to use when
teaching how parameters are passed to a function, or what misconceptions
about nesting HTML tags are most common. This chapter summarizes some
results from research into teaching and learning programming that will
add to your store of PCK.

Computing education research is still a young discipline: while the
American Society for Engineering Education was founded in 1893, and
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 1920, the Computer
Science Teachers Association didn't exist until 2005. The simple truth
is that we don't know as much about how people learn to program as we
do about how they learn to read, play a sport, or do basic arithmetic.
However, conferences like \hreffoot{http://sigcse.org/}{SIGCSE}, \hreffoot{http://iticse.acm.org/}{ITiCSE} and
\hreffoot{https://icer.hosting.acm.org}{ICER} are delivering an ever-increasing stream of rigorous,
insightful studies with practical application. (For those interested
in methods these studies rely on, \cite{Ihan2016} summarizes the
ones used most often.)

As with all research, though, some caution is required to interpret
these results. Most studies look at school children and university
undergraduates, both because those are the populations that researchers
have easiest access to \cite{Henr2010} and because those are the ages
at which people most often learn to program; less is known about adults
learning to program in free-range settings.

Theories may change as more and better data becomes available, so if
this was an academic treatise, it would preface most claims with
statements like, ``Research may seem to indicate that{\ldots}''
However, since actual teachers in actual classrooms have to make
decisions regardless of whether research has clear answers yet or not,
this chapter presents actionable approximations of the truth rather than
nuanced perhapses.

\begin{aside}{Jargon}
  Like any specialty, computing education research has its jargon. The
  term \gref{g:cs1}{CS1} refers to an introductory semester-long
  programming course in which learners meet variables, loops, and
  functions for the first time, while \gref{g:cs2}{CS2} refers to
  a second course that covers basic data structures like stacks and
  queues. The term \gref{g:cs0}{CS0} is also now being used to
  refer to an introductory course for people without any prior
  experience who aren't intending to continue with computing (at least
  not right away).

  A CS1 course is often useful for undergraduates in other
  disciplines; a CS2 course designed for computer science learners is
  usually less relevant for artists, ecologists, and other \gref{g:end-user-programmer}{end-user
    programmers}, but is sometimes the only next
  step available at their institution. Full definitions for these
  terms and others can be found in the \hreffoot{https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations}{ACM Curriculum
    Guidelines}.
\end{aside}

\seclbl{How Do Novices Program?}{s:pck-programming}

\cite{Solo1984,Solo1986} pioneered the exploration of novice and
expert programming strategies. The key finding is that experts know both
``what'' and ``how'', i.e., they understand what to put into programs \emph{and}
they have a set of patterns or plans to guide their construction.
Novices lack both, but most teachers focus solely on the former, even
though bugs are often caused by not having a strategy for solving the
problem rather than to lack of knowledge about the language.

The most important recommendation in this chapter is therefore to \emph{show
learners how to program}. This is consistent with the work on cognitive
load theory presented in \chapref{s:load}, and \cite{Mull2007b} is
just one of many studies proving its benefits; live coding
(\secref{s:performance-live}) is effective in part because it puts
``how'' front and center.

When demonstrating the act of programming, teachers should emphasize the
importance of small steps with frequent feedback \cite{Blik2014}.
They should also emphasize the importance of picking a plan and sticking
to it rather than making more-or-less random changes to the program and
hoping that they'll work---as \cite{Spoh1985} found, merging plans
and/or goals can yield bugs because of goals being dropped or
fragmented.

Another aspect of ``how'' that teachers should present and discuss is the
order in which code is written. \cite{Ihan2011} describes a tool for
solving Parsons Problems. They found that experienced programmers often
drag the method signature to the beginning, then add the majority of the
control flow (i.e., loops and conditionals), and only then add details
like variable initialization and handling of corner cases. This
out-of-order authoring is foreign to novices, who read and write code in
the order it's presented on the page; again, one of the benefits of live
coding (\secref{s:performance-live}) is that it gives them a chance
to see the sequence that more advanced programmers actually use.

\subsection*{Roles of Variables}

One body of work that I have found very useful in teaching programming
plans to novices is the collection of single-variable design patterns
in \cite{Kuit2004,Byck2005,Saja2006}. Labelling
the parts of novices' programs gives them a vocabulary to think with
and a set of programming plans for constructing code of their own. The
patterns are listed on the \hreffoot{http://saja.kapsi.fi/var\_roles/}{Roles of Variables
website}, which also includes examples of each:

\begin{description}
\item[Fixed value:]
A data item that does not get a new proper value after its
initialization.
\item[Stepper:]
A data item stepping through a systematic, predictable succession of
values.
\item[Walker:]
A data item traversing in a data structure.
\item[Most-recent holder:]
A data item holding the latest value encountered in going through a
succession of unpredictable values, or simply the latest value
obtained as input.
\item[Most-wanted holder:]
A data item holding the best or otherwise most appropriate value
encountered so far.
\item[Gatherer:]
A data item accumulating the effect of individual values.
\item[Follower:]
A data item that gets its new value always from the old value of
some other data item.
\item[One-way flag:]
A two-valued data item that cannot get its initial value once the
value has been changed.
\item[Temporary:]
A data item holding some value for a very short time only.
\item[Organizer:]
A data structure storing elements that can be rearranged.
\item[Container:]
A data structure storing elements that can be added and removed.
\end{description}

\seclbl{How Do Novices Debug and Test?}{s:pck-debug}

A decade ago, \cite{McCa2008} wrote, ``It is surprising how little
page space is devoted to bugs and debugging in most introductory
programming textbooks.'' Little has changed since: there are hundreds of
books on compilers and operating systems, but only a handful about
debugging, and I have never seen an undergraduate course on the subject.
One reason is that debugging is a ``how'' rather than a ``what''; again, one
of the benefits of live coding is that it gives teachers a chance to
demonstrate the process in a way that textbooks cannot
(\secref{s:performance-live}).

\cite{List2004,List2009} found that many novices struggled to predict
the output of short pieces of code and to select the correct completion
of the code from a set of possibilities when told what it was supposed
to do. More recently, \cite{Harr2018} found that the gap between
being able to trace code and being able to write it has largely closed
by CS2, but that novices who still have a gap (in either direction) are
likely to do poorly in the course.

Our second recommendation is therefore to \emph{teach novices how to debug}.
\cite{Fitz2008,Murp2008} found that good debuggers were good
programmers, but not all good programmers were good at debugging. Those
who were used a symbolic debugger to step through their programs, traced
execution by hand, wrote tests, and re-read the spec frequently, which
are all teachable habits. However, tracing execution step by step was
sometimes used ineffectively: for example, a novice might put the same
\texttt{print} statement in both parts of an \texttt{if}-\texttt{else}. Novices would also
comment out lines that were actually correct as they tried to isolate a
problem; teachers can make both of these mistakes deliberately, point
them out, and correct them to help novices get past them.

Teaching novices how to debug can also help make classes easier to
manage. \cite{Alqa2017} found that learners with more experience
solved debugging problems significantly faster, but times varied widely:
4--10 minutes was a typical range for individual exercises, which means
that some learners need 2--3 times longer than others to get through the
same exercises. Teaching the slower learners what the faster ones are
doing will help make the group's overall progress more uniform.

Debugging depends on being able to read code, which multiple studies
have shown is the single most effective way to find bugs
\cite{Basi1987,Keme2009,Bacc2013}. The code
quality rubric developed in \cite{Steg2014,Steg2016a},
which is online at \cite{Steg2016b}, is a good checklist of things
to look for, though it is best presented in chunks rather than all at
once.

Having learners read code and summarize its behavior is a good exercise
(\secref{s:individual-strategies}), but often takes too long to be
practical in class. Having them predict a program's output just before
it is run, on the other hand, helps reinforce learning
(\secref{s:classroom-practices}) and also gives them a natural
moment to ask ``what if'' questions. Instructors or learners can also
trace changes to variables as they go along (\figref{f:pck-sketch}),
which \cite{Cunn2017} found was effective.

\figlbl{../../figures/sketching-variables.pdf}{Tracing the Values of Variables}{f:pck-sketch}

When it comes to testing, novices seem just as reluctant to do it as
professional programmers. There's no doubt it's
valuable---\cite{Cart2017} found that high-performing novices spent a
lot of time testing, while low performers spent much more time working
on code with errors---and many instructors require learners to write tests
for assignments. The question is, how well do they do this?

One answer comes from \cite{Bria2015}, which scored learners'
programs by how many teacher-provided test cases those programs passed,
and conversely scores test cases written by learners according to how
many deliberately-seeded bugs they caught. They found that novices'
tests often have low coverage (i.e., they don't test most of the code)
and that they often test many things at once, which makes it hard to
pinpoint the causes of errors.

Another answer comes from \cite{Edwa2014b}, which looked at all of
the bugs in all novices' code submissions combined and identified those
detected by the novices' test suite. They found that novices' tests only
detected an average of 13.6\% of the faults present in the entire program
population. What's more, 90\% of the novices' tests were very similar,
which indicates that novices mostly write tests to confirm that code is
doing what it's supposed to rather than to find cases where it isn't.

One approach to teaching better testing practices is to define a
programming problem by providing a set of tests to be passed rather than
through a written description (\secref{s:exercises-classics}).
Before doing this, though, take a moment to look at how many tests
you've written for your own code recently, and then decide whether
you're teaching what you believe people should do, or what they (and
you) actually do.

\seclbl{What Misconceptions Do Novices Have?}{s:pck-misunderstand}

\chapref{s:models} explained why clearing up novices' misconceptions
is just as important as teaching them strategies for solving problems.
The biggest misconception novices have---sometimes called the ``superbug''
in coding---is the belief that they can communicate with a computer in the
same way that they would with a human being, i.e., that the computer
understands intention the way that a human being would
\cite{Pea1986}. Our third recommendation is therefore to \emph{teach
novices that computers don't understand programs}, i.e., that calling a
variable ``cost'' doesn't guarantee that its value is actually a cost.

\cite{Sorv2018} presents over 40 other misconceptions that
instructors can also try to clear up, many of which are also discussed
in \cite{Qian2017}'s survey. One is the belief that variables in
programs work the same way they do in spreadsheets, i.e., that after
executing:

\begin{minted}{text}
grade = 65
total = grade + 10
grade = 80
print(total)
\end{minted}

the value of \texttt{total} will be 90 rather than 75 \cite{Kohn2017}.
(This is an example of the way in which novices construct a
plausible-but-wrong mental model by making analogies.) Other
misconceptions include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A variable holds the history of the values it has been assigned,
  i.e., it remembers what its value used to be.
\item
  Two objects with the same value for a \texttt{name} or \texttt{id} attribute are
  guaranteed to be the same object.
\item
  Functions are executed as they are defined, or are executed in the
  order in which they are defined.
\item
  A \texttt{while} loop's condition is constantly evaluated, and the loop
  stops as soon as it becomes false. Conversely, the conditions in
  \texttt{if} statements are also constantly evaluated, and their statements
  are executed as soon as the condition becomes true, no matter where
  the flow of control is at the time.
\item
  Assignment moves values, i.e., after \texttt{a\ =\ b}, the variable \texttt{b} is
  empty.
\end{itemize}

Instead of looking directly at misconceptions, \cite{Muhl2016}
analyzed 350 concept maps and compared those who had done a CS course
and those who had not. Unsurprisingly, they found that the maps drawn by
those with previous experience looked more like the maps experts would
draw, but the details highlighted what exactly learners were taking away
from their lessons: ``program'' was a central concept in both sets of
concept maps, but the next most central for those with prior exposure
were ``class'' (in the object-oriented sense) and ``data structure'', while
for those without, they were ``processor'' and ``data''.

\seclbl{What Mistakes Do Novices Make?}{s:pck-mistakes}

The mistakes novices make can tell us what to prioritize in our
teaching, but it turns out that most teachers don't know how common
different kinds of mistakes actually are. The largest study of this is
\cite{Brow2017}'s study of novice Java programs, which found that
mismatched quotes and parentheses are the most common type of error, but
also the easiest to fix, while some mistakes (like putting the condition
of an \texttt{if} in \texttt{\{\}} instead of \texttt{()}) are most often made only once.
Unsurprisingly, mistakes that produce compiler errors are fixed much
faster than ones that don't.

Some mistakes, however, are made many times, like invoking methods with
the wrong arguments (e.g., passing a string instead of an integer). One
caution when reading this research is how important it is to distinguish
mistakes from work in progress: for example, an empty \texttt{if} statement or
a method that's defined but not yet used may be a sign of incomplete
code rather than an error.

\cite{Brow2017} also compared the mistakes novices actually make with
what their teachers thought they made. They found that,
``{\ldots}educators formed only a weak consensus about which
mistakes are most frequent, that their rankings bore only a moderate
correspondence to the students in the{\ldots}data, and that
educators' experience had no effect on this level of agreement.'' For
example, mistaking \texttt{=} (assignment) and \texttt{==} (equality) in loop
condition tests wasn't nearly as common as most teachers believed.

\begin{aside}{Not Just for Code}
  \cite{Park2015} collected data from an online HTML editor during an
  introductory web development course. Nearly all learners made syntax
  errors that remained unresolved weeks into the course. 20\% of these
  errors related to the relatively complex rules that dictate \emph{when} it
  is valid for HTML elements to be nested in one another, but 35\%
  related to the simpler tag syntax determining \emph{how} HTML elements are
  nested. (The tendency of many instructors to say, ``But the rules are
  simple,'' is a good example of expert blind spot discussed in
  \chapref{s:memory}{\ldots})
\end{aside}

\seclbl{What Are We Teaching Them Now?}{s:pck-now}

Very little is known about what coding bootcamps and other free-range
initiatives teach, in part because many are reluctant to share their
curriculum. We do know more about what is taught in schools:
\cite{Luxt2017} surveyed the topics included in introductory
programming courses, categorized their findings under a dozen headings,
and ranked them by frequency:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
Topic & Number of Courses & (\%)\\
Programming Process & 90 & (87\%)\\
Abstract Programming Thinking & 65 & (63\%)\\
Data Structures & 41 & (40\%)\\
Object-Oriented Concepts & 37 & (36\%)\\
Control Structures & 34 & (33\%)\\
Operations \& Functions & 27 & (26\%)\\
Data Types & 24 & (23\%)\\
Input/Output & 18 & (17\%)\\
Libraries & 15 & (15\%)\\
Variables \& Assignment & 14 & (14\%)\\
Recursion & 10 & (10\%)\\
Pointers \& Memory Management & 5 & (5\%)\\
\end{longtable}

This paper also showed how concepts are connected. For example, it's
impossible to explain how operator precedence works without first
explaining a few operators, and difficult to explain those in a
meaningful way without first introducing variables (because otherwise
you're comparing constants in expressions like \texttt{5\textless{}3}, which is
confusing).

Similarly, \cite{Rich2017} reviewed a hundred articles to find
learning trajectories for computing classes in elementary and middle
schools, and presented results for sequencing, repetition, and
conditionals. These are essentially collective concept maps, as they
combine and rationalize the implicit and explicit thinking of many
different educators. \figref{f:pck-trajectory} shows the learning
trajectories for conditionals.

\figlbl{../../figures/conditionals.pdf}{Learning Trajectory for Conditions from \cite{Rich2017}}{f:pck-trajectory}

But there can be a world of difference between what instructors teach
and what learners learn, and study after study has shown that teaching
evaluations don't correlate with actual learning outcomes
\cite{Star2014,Uttl2017}. To find out how much novices are actually
learning, we therefore have to use other measures or do direct studies.
Taking the former approach, roughly two-thirds of post-secondary
students pass their first computing course, with some variations
depending on class size and so on, but with no significant differences
over time or based on language \cite{Benn2007a,Wats2014}.

How does prior experience affect these results? To find out,
\cite{Wilc2018} compared the performance and confidence of novices
with and without prior programming experience in CS1 and CS2. They found
that novices with prior experience outscored novices without by 10\% in
CS1, but those differences disappeared by the end of CS2. They also
found that women with prior exposure outperformed their male peers in
all areas, but were consistently less confident in their abilities; we
will return to this issue in \secref{s:motivation-inclusivity}.

As for direct studies of how much novices learn, \cite{McCr2001}
presented a multi-site international study, which was later replicated
by \cite{Utti2013}. According to the first study, ``{\ldots}the
disappointing results suggest that many students do not know how to
program at the conclusion of their introductory courses.'' More
specifically, ``For a combined sample of 216 students from four
universities, the average score was 22.89 out of 110 points on the
general evaluation criteria developed for this study.'' This result may
say as much about teachers' expectations as it does about student
ability, but either way, our fourth recommendation is to \emph{measure and
track results} in ways that can be compared over time, so that you can
tell if your lessons are becoming more or less effective.

\seclbl{Do Languages Matter?}{s:pck-language}

The short answer is ``yes'': novices learn to program faster and also
learn more using blocks-based tools like Scratch
(\figref{f:pck-scratch}) that make syntax errors impossible
\cite{Wein2017b}. And block interfaces encourage exploration in a way
that text does not; like all good tools, Scratch can be learned
accidentally \cite{Malo2010}.

Our fifth recommendation is therefore to \emph{start children and teens
with blocks-based interfaces} before moving to text-based systems. The
age qualification is there because Scratch (deliberately) looks like
it's meant for younger users; while imitators like \hreffoot{https://developers.google.com/blockly/}{Blockly}
look more grown-up, it can still be hard to convince adults to take
them seriously.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{../../figures/scratch.jpg}
\caption{Scratch (from https://opensource.com/article/18/4/designing-game-scratch-open-jam)}
\label{f:pck-scratch}
\end{figure}

Scratch has probably been studied more than any other programming tool,
and we know a great deal about how it is used. As just one example,
\cite{Aiva2016} analyzed over 250,000 Scratch projects and found
(among other things) that about 28\% of projects have some blocks that
are never called or triggered. The authors hypothesize that users may be
using them as a scratchpad to keep bits of code they don't (yet) want to
throw away.

\cite{Grov2017,Mlad2017} studied novices learning about loops in
Scratch, Logo, and Python, and found that misconceptions about loops are
minimized when using a block-based language rather than a text-based
language. What's more, as tasks become more complex (such as using
nested loops) the differences become larger.

\cite{Wein2017a} studied people using a tool that allowed them to
switch between blocks and text for programming. They found that
learners tend to migrate from blocks to text over time, but when
learners shifted from text to blocks, their next action was to add a
new type of command. This may be because browsing available commands
is easier with blocks, or because blocks make syntax errors with
unfamiliar new commands impossible. The authors say, ``While it is
often claimed that blocks-based programming environments offer the
advantage of reducing syntax errors, our findings suggest that blocks
also offer information about what is possible in the space and provide
a low-stakes means of exploring unfamiliar code.'' New tools like
\hreffoot{https://www.greenfoot.org/frames/}{Stride} are trying to smooth the transition between blocks
and text even further; when combined with programming notebooks like
\hreffoot{http://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter} and \hreffoot{http://stenci.la/}{Stencila}, they may eventually
eliminate the distinction altogether.

\begin{aside}{Harder Than Necessary}
  \cite{Stef2013} has shown that the creators of programming language
  make those languages harder to learn by not doing basic usability
  testing. For example, ``{\ldots}the three most common words for
  looping in computer science, \texttt{for}, \texttt{while}, and \texttt{foreach}, were rated
  as the three most unintuitive choices by non-programmers.'' More
  fundamentally, their work shows that C-style syntax (as used in Java
  and Perl) is just as hard for novices to learn as a randomly-designed
  syntax, but that the syntax of languages such as Python and Ruby is
  significantly easier to learn, and the syntax of their own language,
  Quorum, is easier still, because they are testing each new feature
  before adding it to the language. (\cite{Stef2017} is a useful
  brief summary of what we actually know about designing programming
  languages and why we believe it's true.)
\end{aside}

\subsection*{Object-Oriented and Functional Programming}

Objects and classes are power tools for experienced programmers, and
many educators advocate an ``objects first'' approach to teaching
programming (though they sometimes disagree on exactly what that means
\cite{Benn2007b}). \cite{Sorv2014} describes and motivates this
approach, and \cite{Koll2015} describes three generations of tools
designed to support novice programming in object-oriented environments.

Introducing objects early has a few special challenges.
\cite{Mill2016b} found that most novices using Python struggled to
understand \texttt{self} (which refers to ``this object''): they omitted it in
method definitions, failed to use it when referencing object attributes,
or both. Object reference errors were also more common than other
errors; the authors speculate that this is partly due to the difference
in syntax between \texttt{obj.method(param)} and \texttt{def\ method(self,\ param)}.
\cite{Rago2017} found something similar in high school students, and
that high school teachers often weren't clear on the concept either.

Another approach is exemplified by the \hreffoot{http://www.bootstrapworld.org/}{Bootstrap project},
which is based on the \gref{g:functional-programming}{functional
programming} paradigm. This work draws on a
rich tradition going back to languages like Scheme and Lisp, and to
classic textbooks like
\cite{Fell2001,Frie1995,Abel1996}. If functional
programming continues to gain ground among professional programmers,
this approach may grow more popular for teaching.

On balance, we recommend that instructors \emph{use procedural languages} to
start with, i.e., that defining classes and using higher-order functions
not be taught until learners understand basic control structures and
data types. How quickly these topics should be introduced depends on the
audience: if learners want to build web applications in JavaScript, for
example, they're going to have to master callbacks much earlier than if
they want to generate reports using C\#.

\subsection*{Type Declarations}

Programmers have argued for decades about whether variables' data types
should have to be declared or not. One recent empirical finding is
\cite{Gao2017}, which found that about 15\% of bugs in JavaScript
programs could be caught by requiring type declarations, which is either
high or low depending on what answer you wanted in the first place.

However, programming and learning to program are different activities,
and results from the former don't necessarily apply to the latter.
\cite{Endr2014} found that requiring novices to declare variable
types does add some complexity to programs, but it pays off fairly
quickly by acting as documentation for a method's use---in particular, by
forestalling questions about what's available and how to use it.

We don't know enough yet to recommend typed or untyped languages for
novices. Now that Python allows optional typing, though, it may be
feasible for researchers to explore whether it can or should be
introduced gradually.

\subsection*{Does Variable Naming Style Matter?}

\cite{Kern1999} says, ``Programmers are often encouraged to use long
variable names regardless of context. This is a mistake: clarity is
often achieved through brevity.'' Lots of programmers believe this, but
\cite{Hofm2017} found that using full words in variable names led to
an average of 19\% faster comprehension compared to letters and
abbreviations.

In contrast, \cite{Beni2017} found that using single-letter variable
names didn't affect novices' ability to modify code. This may be because
their programs are shorter than professionals', or because some
single-letter variable names have implicit types and meanings: most
programmers assume \texttt{i}, \texttt{j}, and \texttt{n} are integers, and \texttt{s} is a string,
while \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, and \texttt{z} are either floating-point numbers or integers
more or less equally.

How important is this? \cite{Bink2012} reported a series of studies
that found that reading and understanding code is fundamentally
different from reading prose: ``{\ldots}the more formal structure
and syntax of source code allows programmers to assimilate and
comprehend parts of the code quite rapidly independent of style. In
particular{\ldots}beacons and program plans play a large role in
comprehension.'' It also found that experienced developers are relatively
unaffected by identifier style, so our recommendation is just to use
consistent style in all examples.

Since most languages have style guides (e.g., \hreffoot{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP 8} for
Python) and tools to check that code follows these guidelines, our
full recommendation is to \emph{use tools to ensure that all code examples
adhere to a consistent style}.

\seclbl{Does Better Feedback Help?}{s:pck-error}

Incomprehensible error messages are a major source of frustration for
novices (and sometimes for experienced programmers as well). Several
researchers have therefore explored whether better error messages would
help alleviate this. For example, \cite{Beck2016} rewrote some of the
Java compiler's messages so that instead of:

\begin{minted}{text}
C:\stj\Hello.java:2: error: cannot find symbol
        public static void main(string[ ] args){
^
1 error
Process terminated ... there were problems.
\end{minted}

learners would see:

\begin{minted}{text}
Looks like a problem on line number 2.
If "string" refers to a datatype, capitalize the 's'!
\end{minted}

Sure enough, novices given these messages made fewer repeated errors and
fewer errors overall.

\cite{Bari2017} went further and used eye tracking to show that
despite the grumblings of compiler writers, people really do read error
messages---in fact, they spend 13--25\% of their time doing this. However,
reading error messages turns out to be as difficult as reading source
code, and how difficult it is to read the error messages strongly
predicts task performance. Instructors should therefore \emph{give learners
practice in reading and interpreting error messages}. \cite{Marc2011}
has a rubric for responses to error messages that can be useful in
grading such exercises.

\subsection*{Does Visualization Help?}

The idea of visualizing programs is perennially popular, and tools
like \cite{Guo2013} (a web-based tool for visualizing the
execution of Python programs) and \hreffoot{http://latentflip.com/loupe/}{Loupe} (which shows how
JavaScript's event loop works) are both useful teaching aids.
However, people learn more from constructing visualizations than they
do from viewing visualizations constructed by others
\cite{Stas1998,Ceti2016}, so does visualization actually
help learning?

To answer this, \cite{Cunn2017} replicated an earlier study of the
kinds of sketching students do when tracing code execution. They found
that not sketching at all correlates with lower success, while tracing
changes to variables' values by writing new values near their names as
they change was the most effective strategy (\figref{f:pck-sketch}).

One possible confounding effect they checked was time: since sketchers
take significantly more time to solve problems, do they do better just
because they think for longer? The answer is no: there was no
correlation between the time taken and the score achieved. Our
recommendation is therefore to \emph{teach students to trace variables'
values when debugging}.

\begin{aside}{Flowcharts}
  One often-overlooked finding about visualization is that students
  understand flowcharts better than pseudocode \emph{if both are equally well
    structured} \cite{Scan1989}. Earlier work showing that pseudocode
  outperformed flowcharts used structured pseudocode and tangled
  flowcharts; when the playing field was levelled, novices did better
  with the graphical representation.
\end{aside}

\seclbl{What Else Can We Do to Help?}{s:pck-help}

\cite{Viha2014} examined the average improvement in pass rates of
various kinds of intervention in programming classes. As they themselves
point out, there are many reasons to take their findings with a grain of
salt: the pre-change teaching practices are rarely stated clearly, the
quality of change is not judged, and only 8.3\% of studies reported
negative findings, so either there is positive reporting bias or the way
we're teaching right now is almost the worst way possible and anything
would be an improvement. And like many other studies discussed in this
chapter, they were only looking at university classes, so their findings
may not generalize to other groups.

With all those caveats in mind, they found ten things instructors can do
to improve outcomes (\figref{f:pck-interventions}):

\begin{description}
\item[Collaboration:]
Activities that encourage student collaboration either in classrooms
or labs.
\item[Content Change:]
Parts of the teaching material were changed or updated.
\item[Contextualization:]
Course content and activities were aligned towards a specific
context such as games or media.
\item[CS0:]
Creation of a preliminary course to be taken before the introductory
programming course; could be organized only for some (e.g., at-risk)
students.
\item[Game Theme:]
A game-themed component was introduced to the course.
\item[Grading Scheme:]
A change in the grading scheme; the most common change was to
increase the amount of points rewarded from programming activities,
while reducing the weight of the course exam.
\item[Group Work:]
Activities with increased group work commitment such as team-based
learning and cooperative learning.
\item[Media Computation:]
Activities explicitly declaring the use of media computation
(\chapref{s:motivation}).
\item[Peer Support:]
Support by peers in form of pairs, groups, hired peer mentors or
tutors.
\item[Other Support:]
An umbrella term for all support activities, e.g. increased teacher
hours, additional support channels, etc.
\end{description}

This list highlights the importance of cooperative learning.
\cite{Beck2013} looked at this specifically over three academic years
in courses taught by two different instructors, and found significant
benefits overall and for many subgroups: they not only had higher
grades, they left fewer questions blank on the final exam, which
indicates greater self-efficacy and willingness to try to debug things.

As noted earlier, writing code isn't the only way to teach people how
to program. \cite{Shel2017} reports that having novices work on
computational creativity exercises improves grades at several
levels. A typical exercise is to identify an everyday object (such as
nail clipper, a paper clip, Scotch tape) and describe the object in
terms of its inputs, outputs and functions. This kind of teaching is
sometimes called ``unplugged''; the \hreffoot{https://csunplugged.org/en/}{CS Unplugged} site
has a collection of lessons and exercises for doing this.

\seclbl{Exercises}{s:pck-exercises}

\subsection*{Checking for Common Errors (individual/20)}

This list of common errors is taken from \cite{Sirk2012}. Pick three,
and write an exercise for each to check that learners \emph{aren't} making
that mistake.

\begin{description}
\item[Inverted assignment:]
The student assigns the value of the left-hand variable to the
right-hand side variable, rather than the other way around.
\item[Wrong branch:]
Even though the conditional evaluates to \texttt{False}, the student jumps
to the \texttt{then} clause.
\item[Wrong \texttt{False}:]
As soon as the conditional evaluates to \texttt{False} , the student
returns \texttt{False} from the function.
\item[Executing function instead of defining it:]
The student believes that a function is executed as it is defined.
\item[Unevaluated parameters:]
The student believes the function starts running before the
parameters have been evaluated.
\item[Parameter evaluated in the wrong frame:]
The student creates parameter variables in the caller's frame, not
in the callee's.
\item[Failing to store return value:]
The student does not assign the return value in the caller.
\item[Assignment copies object:]
The student creates a new object rather than copying a reference.
\item[Method call without subject:]
The student tries to call a method from a class without first
creating an instance of the class.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Mangled Code (pairs/15)}

\cite{Chen2017} describes exercises in which students reconstruct
code that has been mangled by removing comments, deleting or replacing
lines of code, moving lines, inserting extra unneeded lines, and so on.
Student performance on these correlates strongly with performance on
assessments in which students write code (i.e., whatever traditional
assignments are measuring, these are measuring as well), but these
questions require less (in-person) work to mark. Take the solution to a
programming exercise you've created in the past, mangle it in two
different ways, and swap with a partner.

\subsection*{The Rainfall Problem (pairs/10)}

\cite{Solo1986} introduced the Rainfall Problem: write a program that
repeatedly reads in positive integers until it reads the integer 99999.
After seeing 99999, the program should print out the average of the
numbers seen. This problem has been used in many subsequent studies of
programming \cite{Fisl2014,Simo2013,Sepp2015}.

Solve the Rainfall Problem in the programming language of your choice.
Compare your solutions with those of your partner.

\subsection*{Roles of Variables (pairs/15)}

Take a short program you have written (5--15 lines) and classify each of
its variables using the categories defined in
\secref{s:pck-programming}. Compare your classifications with those
of a partner: where did you agree? When you disagreed, did you
understand each other's view?

\subsection*{Choose Your Own Adventures (individual/10)}

Which of the three approaches described in \cite{Sorv2014}
(\secref{s:pck-now}) do you use when teaching? Or is your approach
best described in some other way?

\subsection*{What Are You Teaching? (individual/10)}

Compare the topics you teach to the list developed in \cite{Luxt2017}
(\secref{s:pck-now}). Which topics do you cover? What extra topics
do you cover that aren't in their list?

\subsection*{Beneficial Activities (individual/10)}

Look at the list of interventions developed by \cite{Viha2014}
(\secref{s:pck-help}). Which of these things do you already do in
your classes? Which ones could you easily add? Which ones are
irrelevant?

\subsection*{Visualizations (individual/10)}

What visualization do you most like to use when teaching? Is it a static
image or an animation? Do you show it to your learners, do they discover
it on their own, or something in between?

\subsection*{Misconceptions and Challenges (small groups/15)}

The \hreffoot{http://www.pd4cs.org/}{Professional Development for CS Principles Teaching} site
includes \hreffoot{http://www.pd4cs.org/mc-index/}{a detailed list of student misconceptions and
exercises}. Working in small groups, choose one
section (such as data structures or functions) and go through their
list. Which of these misconceptions do you remember having when you
were a learner? Which do you still have? Which have you seen in your
learners?
