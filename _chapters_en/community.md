Many well-intentioned people want the world to be a better place, but
don't actually want anything important to change. A lot of grassroots
efforts to teach programming fall into this category: they want to teach
children and adults how to program so that they can get good jobs,
rather than empower them to change the system that has shut them (and
people like them) out of those jobs in the past.

If you are going to build a community, the first and most important
thing you have to decide is what *you* want: to help people succeed in
the world we have, or to give them a way to make a better one. Either
way, you have to accept that one person can only do so much. Just as we
learn best together, we teach best when we are teaching with other
people, and the best way to achieve that is to build a community.

And as Anu Partanen [pointed out][partanen-finland-schools], sometimes
you need to fix several things in order to fix one. Finland's teachers
aren't successful in isolation: they are able to achieve outstanding
results because their country's citizens truly value equality of
opportunity. People (and countries) that try to adopt their teaching
methods without ensuring that children (and parents) are well
nourished, safe, and treated fairly by the courts will have a more
difficult time. This doesn't mean you have to fix all of society's
ills in order to teach programming, but it *does* mean that you have
to understand and be involved in what happens to your learners outside
of your class if you want that class to work.

A framework in which to think about educational communities is
[situated learning](#g:situated-learning), which focuses on how
[legitimate peripheral
participation](#g:legitimate-peripheral-participation) leads to people
becoming members of a [community of
practice](#g:community-of-practice) [[Weng2015](#CITE)]. Unpacking
those terms, a community of practice is a group of people bound
together by interest in some activity, such as knitting or particle
physics. Legitimate peripheral participation means doing simple,
low-risk tasks that community nevertheless recognizes as valid
contributions: making your first scarf, stuffing envelopes during an
election campaign, or proof-reading documentation for open source
software.

Situated learning focuses on the transition from being a newcomer to
being accepted as a peer by those who are already community members.
This typically means starting with simplified tasks and tools, then
doing similar tasks with more complex tools, and finally tackling the
exercises of advanced practitioners. For example, children learning
music may start by playing nursery rhymes on a recorder or ukulele, then
play other simple songs on a trumpet or saxophone in a band, and finally
start exploring their own musical tastes. Healthy communities of
practice understand and support these progressions, and recognize that
each step is meant to give people a ramp rather than a cliff. Some of
the ways they do this include:

Problem solving:
: "I'm stuck---Can we work on this design and brainstorm some ideas?"

Requests for information:
: "Where can I find the code to connect to the server?"

Seeking experience:
: "Has anyone dealt with a customer in this situation?"

Reusing assets:
: "I have a proposal for an event website that I wrote for a client
  last year you can use as a starting point."

Coordination and synergy:
: "Can we combine our purchases of web hosting to get a discount?"

Building an argument:
: "How do people in other companies do this? Armed with this
  information it will be easier to convince my CEO to make some
  changes."

Growing confidence:
: "Before I do it, I'll run it through my community first to see what
  they think."

Discussing developments:
: "What do you think of the new work tracking system? Does it really
  help?"

Documenting projects:
: "We have faced this problem five times now. Let us write it down
  once and for all."

Visits:
: "Can we come and see your after-school program? We need to establish
  one in our city."

Mapping knowledge and identifying gaps:
: "Who knows what, and what are we missing? What other groups should
  we connect with?"

Whatever the domain, situated learning emphasizes that learning is a
social activity. In order to be effective and sustainable, teaching
therefore needs to be rooted in a community; if one doesn't exist, you
need to build one. There are at least [four types][community-types]:

Community of action:
: people focused on a shared goal, such as getting someone elected.

Community of concern:
: members are brought together by a shared exercise, such as dealing
  with depression.

Community of interest:
: focused on a shared love of something like backgammon or knitting.

Community of place:
: of people who happen to live or work side by side.

Most real communities are mixes of these, such as people in Toronto who
like teaching tech; what matters is that you pick something and stick
with it.

## Learn, Then Do {#s:community-learn-then-do}

The first step in building a community is to decide if you really need
to, or whether you would be more effective joining an existing
organization. Thousands of groups are already teaching people tech
skills, from the [4-H Club][4h-club] and [literacy
programs][frontier-college] to get-into-coding non-profits like [Black
Girls Code][black-girls-code] and [Bridge][bridge]. Joining an
existing group will give you a head start on teaching, an immediate
set of colleagues, and a chance to learn more about how to run things;
hopefully, learning those skills will be more important than being
able to say that you're the founder or leader of something new.

Whether you join an existing group or set up one of your own, you owe
it to yourself and everyone who's going to work with you to find out
what's been done before. People have been writing about grassroots
organizing for decades; [[Alin1989](#CITE)] is probably the best-known
work on the subject, while [[Brow2007](#CITE),[Midw2010](#CITE)] are
practical manuals rooted in decades of practice. If you want to read
more deeply, [[Adam1975](#CITE)] is a history of the Highlander Folk
School, whose approach has been emulated by many successful groups,
while [[Spal2014](#CITE)] is a guide to teaching adults written by
someone with deep personal roots in organizing, and
[NonprofitReady.org][nonprofit-ready] offers free professional
development training.

## Three Steps {#s:community-three-steps}

Everyone who gets involved with your organization, including you, goes
through three phases: recruitment, retention, and retirement (from the
organization). You don't need to worry about this cycle when you're just
getting started, but it *is* worth thinking about as soon as you have
more than a couple of non-founders involved.

The first step is recruiting volunteers. Your marketing should help you
with this by making your organization findable, and by making its
mission and its value to volunteers clear to people who might want to
get involved. Share stories that exemplify the kind of help you want as
well as stories about the people you're helping, and make it clear that
there are many ways to get involved. (We discuss this in more detail in
the next section.)

Your best source of new recruits is your own classes: "see one, do one,
teach one" has worked well for volunteer organizations for as long as
there have *been* volunteer organizations. Make sure that every class or
other encounter ends with two sentences explaining how people can help,
and that help is welcome. People who come to you this way will know what
you do, and will have recent experience of being on the receiving end of
what you offer that they can draw on, which helps your organization
avoid collective [expert blind spot](#g:expert-blind-spot).

Recruiting doesn't end when someone first shows up: if you don't follow
through, people will come out once or twice, then decide that what
you're doing isn't for them and disappear. One thing you can do to get
newcomers over this initial hump is to have them take part in group
activities before they do anything on their own, both so that they get a
sense of how your organization does things, and so that they build
social ties that will keep them involved.

Another thing you can do is give newcomers a mentor, and make sure the
mentors actually do some proactive mentoring. The most important things
a mentor can do are make introductions and explain the unwritten rules,
so make it clear to mentors that these are their primary
responsibilities, and they are to report back to you every few weeks to
tell you what they've done.

The second part of the volunteer lifecycle is retention, which is a
large enough topic to deserve a long discussion in
[s:community-retention](#SECTION). The third and final part is
retirement. Sooner or later, everyone moves on (including you). When
this happens:

Ask people to be explicit about their departure
: so that everyone knows they've actually left.

Make sure they don't feel embarrassed or ashamed about leaving
: or about anything else.

Give them an opportunity to pass on their knowledge.
: For example, you can ask them to mentor someone for a few weeks as
  their last contribution, or to be interviewed by someone who's
  staying with the organization to collect any stories that are worth
  re-telling.

Make sure they hand over the keys.
: It's awkward to discover six months after someone has left that
  they're the only person who knows how to book a playing field for
  the annual softball game.

Follow up 2--3 months after they leave
: to see if they have any further thoughts about what worked and what
  didn't while they were with you, or any advice to offer that they
  either didn't think to give or were uncomfortable giving on their
  way out the door.

Thank them,
: both when they leave and the next time your group gets together.

## Retention {#s:community-retention}

Saul Alinsky once said, "If your people aren't having a ball doing it,
there is something very wrong." [[Alin1989](#CITE)] Community members
shouldn't expect to enjoy every moment of their work with your
organization, but if they don't enjoy any of it, they won't stay.

Enjoyment doesn't necessarily mean having an annual party: people may
enjoy cooking, coaching, or just working quietly beside others. There
are several things every organization should do to ensure that people
are getting something they value out of their work:

Ask people what they want rather than guessing.
: Just as you are not your learners ([s:process-personas](#SECTION)),
  you are probably different from other members of your organization.
  Ask people what they want to do, what they're comfortable doing
  (which may not be the same thing), what constraints there are on
  their time, and so on. They might start by saying, "I don't
  know---anything!" but even a short conversation will probably
  uncover the fact that they like interacting with people but would
  rather not be managing the group's finances, or vice versa.

Provide many ways to contribute.
: The more ways there are for people to help, the more people will be
  able to help. Someone who doesn't like standing in front of an
  audience may be able to maintain your organization's website or
  handle its accounts; someone who doesn't know how to do anything
  else may be able to proof-read lessons, and so on. The more kinds of
  tasks you do yourself, the fewer opportunities there are for others
  to get involved.

Recognize contributions.
: Everyone likes to be appreciated, so communities should acknowledge
  their members' contributions both publicly and privately by
  mentioning them in presentations, putting them on the website, and
  so on.

Make space.
: Micromanaging or trying to control everything centrally means people
  won't feel they have the autonomy to act, which will probably cause
  them to drift away. In particular, if you're too engaged or too
  quick on the reply button, people have less opportunity to grow as
  members and to create horizontal collaborations. As a result, the
  community will continue to be focused around one or two individuals,
  rather than a highly-connected network in which others feel
  comfortable participating.

Another way to make participation rewarding is to provide training.
Organizations require committees, meetings, budgets, grant proposals,
and dispute resolution; most people are never taught how to do any of
this, any more than they are taught how to teach, but training people to
do these things helps your organization run more smoothly, and the
opportunity to gain transferable skills is a powerful reason for people
to get and stay involved. If you are going to do this, don't try to
provide the training yourself (unless it's what you specialize in). Many
civic and community groups have programs of this kind, and you can
probably make a deal with one of them.

Other groups may be useful in other ways as well, and you may be useful
to them---if not immediately, then tomorrow or next year. You should
therefore set aside an hour or two every month to find allies and
maintain your relationships with them. One way to do this is to ask them
for advice: how do they think you ought to raise awareness of what
you're doing? Where have they found space to run classes? What needs
do they think aren't being met, and would you be able to meet them
(either on your own, or in partnership with them)? Any group that has
been around for a few years will have useful advice; they will also be
flattered to be asked, and will know who you are the next time you call.

One important special case of making things rewarding is to pay people.
Volunteers can do a lot, but eventually tasks like system administration
and accounting need full-time paid staff. When this time comes, you
should either pay people nothing or pay them a proper wage, but not do
anything in between. If you pay them nothing, their actual reward for
their work is the satisfaction of doing good. If you pay them a token
amount, you take that away without giving them the satisfaction of
earning a living.

### Impostor Syndrome

Impostor syndrome thrives in communities with arbitrary, unnecessary
standards, where harsh criticism is the norm, and where secrecy
surrounds the actual process of getting work done, so the Ada
Initiative has [guidelines][ada-guidelines] for communities to go with
those given in [s:motivation-demotivation](#SECTION)for individuals:

Encourage people.
: This is as simple as it is effective.

Discourage hostility and bickering.
: Public, hostile, personal arguments are a natural breeding ground
  for impostor syndrome.

Eliminate hidden barriers to participation.
: Be explicit about welcoming new students and colleagues, and
  thoroughly document how someone can participate in projects and
  events in your research group and at your institution.

As a leader, show your own uncertainties
: and demonstrate your own learning process. When people see leaders
  whom they respect struggling or admitting they didn't already know
  everything when they started, having realistic opinions of their own
  work becomes easier.

Reward and encourage people for mentoring newcomers.
: Officially enshrine mentoring as an important criterion in your
  career advancement process.

Don't make it personal when someone's work isn't up to snuff.
: When enforcing necessary quality standards, don't make the issue
  about the person. They aren't wrong or stupid or a waste of space;
  they've simply done one piece of work that didn't meet your
  expectations.

## Governance {#s:community-governance}

As [[Free1972](#CITE)] pointed out, every organization has a power
structure: the only question is whether it's formal and accountable, or
informal and unaccountable. Make yours one of the first kind: write and
publish the rules governing everything from who's allowed to use the
name and logo to who gets to decide whether people are allowed to charge
money to teach with whatever materials your group has worked up.

Organizations can govern themselves in many different ways, and a full
discussion of the options is outside the scope of this book. For-profit
corporations and incorporated non-profits the two most popular models;
the mechanics vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so you should seek
advice locally before doing anything. (This is one of the times when
having ties with local government or other like-minded organizations
pays off.)

The model I prefer is that of a commons, which is "something managed
jointly by a community according to rules they themselves have evolved
and adopted". As [[Boll2014](#CITE)] emphasizes, all three parts of that
definition are essential: a commons isn't just a shared pasture, but
also includes the community that shares it and the rules they use to do
so.

Most resources, throughout most of human history, have been commons: it
is only in the last few hundred years that impersonal markets have
pushed them to the margins. In order to do so, free-market advocates
have had to convince us we're something we're not (dispassionate
calculators of individual advantage) and erase or devalue local
knowledge and custom with tragic consequences for us individually and
collectively.

Since society has difficulty recognizing commons organizations, and
since most of the people you will want to recruit don't have experience
with them, you will probably wind up having some sort of board, a
director, and other staff. Broadly speaking, your organization can have
either a *service board*, whose members also take on other roles in the
organization, or a *governance board* whose primary responsibility is to
hire, monitor, and if need be fire the director. Board members can be
elected by the community or appointed; in either case, it's important to
prioritize competence over passion (the latter being more important for
the rank and file), and to try to recruit for particular skills such as
accounting, marketing, and so on.

Don't worry about drafting a constitution when you first get started: it
will only result in endless wrangling about what we're going to do
rather than formalization of what you're already doing. When the time
does come to formalize your rules, though, make your organization a
democracy: sooner or later (usually sooner), every appointed board turns
into a mutual agreement society and loses sight of what the community
it's meant to serve actually needs. Giving the community power is
messy, but is the only way invented so far to ensure that an
organization continues to meet people's actual needs.

## Final Thoughts {#s:community-final}

As [[Pign2016](#CITE)] discusses, burnout is a chronic risk in any
community activity. If you don't take care of yourself, you won't be
able to take care of your community.

Every organization eventually needs fresh ideas and fresh leadership.
When that time comes, train your successors and then move on. They will
undoubtedly do things you wouldn't have, but the same is true of every
generation. Few things in life are as satisfying as watching something
you helped build take on a life of its own. Celebrate that---you won't
have any trouble finding something else to keep you busy.

## Exercises {#s:community-exercises}

Several of these exercises are taken from [[Brow2007](#CITE)], which is
an exceptionally useful book on building community organizations.

### What Kind of Community? (individual/15)

Re-read the discussion in the introduction of types of communities and
decide which type or types your group is, or aspires to be.

### People You May Meet (small groups/30)

As an organizer, part of your job is sometimes to help people find a way
to contribute despite themselves. In small groups, pick three of the
people below and discuss how you would help them become a better
contributor to your organization.

Anna
: knows more about every subject than everyone else put together---at
  least, she thinks she does. No matter what you say, she'll correct
  you; no matter what you know, she knows better.

Catherine
: has so little confidence in her own ability that she won't make any
  decision, no matter how small, until she has checked with someone
  else.

Frank
: believes that knowledge is power, and enjoys knowing things that
  other people don't. He can make things work, but when asked how he
  did it, he'll grin and say, "Oh, I'm sure you can figure it out."

Hediyeh
: is quiet. She never speaks up in meetings, even when she knows that
  what other people are saying is wrong. She might contribute to the
  mailing list, but she's very sensitive to criticism, and will always
  back down rather than defending her point of view.

Kenny
: has discovered that most people would rather shoulder his share of
  the work than complain about him, and he takes advantage of it at
  every turn. The frustrating thing is that he's so damn *plausible*
  when someone finally does confront him. "There have been mistakes on
  all sides," he says, or, "Well, I think you're nit-picking."

Melissa
: means well, but somehow something always comes up, and her tasks are
  never finished until the last possible moment. Of course, that means
  that everyone who is depending on her can't do their work until
  *after* the last possible moment...

Raj
: is rude. "It's just the way I talk," he says, "If you can't hack it,
  maybe you should find another team." His favorite phrase is, "That's
  stupid," and he uses obscenity in every second sentence.

answers to those given by other members of your group.

1. How does someone join?

1. Does this process work for your organization?

1. What are the membership criteria?

1. Are these the membership criteria you want?

1. Are people required to agree to any rules of behavior upon joining?

1. Are these the rules for behavior you want?

1. Are there membership dues?

### Borrowing Ideas (whole class/15)

Many of our ideas about how to build a community have been shaped by
our experience of working in open source software development.
[[Foge2005](#CITE)] (which is [available online][producing-oss]) is a
good guide to what has and hasn't worked for those communities, and
the [Open Source Guides site][open-source-guides] has a wealth of
useful information as well. Choose one section of the latter, such as
"Finding Users for Your Project" or "Leadership and Governance", read
it through, and give a two-minute presentation to the group of one
idea from it that you found useful or that you strongly disagreed
with.

### Who Are You? (small groups/20)

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has
published a short, amusing, and above all useful guide to [dealing
with disruptive behaviors][noaa-disruptive]. It categorizes those
behaviors under labels like "talkative", "indecisive", and "shy", and
outlines strategies for handling each. In groups of 3--6, read the
guide and decide which of these descriptions best fits you. Do you
think the strategies described for handling people like you are
effective? Are other strategies equally or more effective?
