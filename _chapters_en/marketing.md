It's hard to get people with academic or technical backgrounds to take
[marketing](#g:marketing) seriously, not least because it's perceived
as being about spin and misdirection. In reality, it is the craft of
seeing things from other people's perspective, understanding their
wants and needs, and finding ways to meet them. This should sound
familiar: many of the techniques introduced in [s:process](#CHAPTER)
do exactly this for lessons. This chapter will look at how to apply
similar ideas to the larger problem of getting people to understand
and support what you're doing.

## What Are You Offering to Whom? {#s:marketing-what-whom}

The first step is to figure out what you are offering to whom, i.e.,
what actually brings in the volunteers, funding, and other support you
need to keep going. As [[Kuch2011](#CITE)] points out, the answer is
often counter-intuitive. For example, most scientists think their papers
are their product, but it's actually their grant proposals, because
those are what brings in money. Their papers are the advertising that
persuades people to fund those proposals, just as albums are now what
persuades people to buy musicians' concert tickets and t-shirts.

You may not be a scientist, so suppose instead that your group is
offering weekend programming workshops to people who are re-entering the
workforce after taking several years out to look after young children.
If your learners are paying enough for your workshops to cover your
costs, then the learners are your customers and the workshops are the
product. If, on the other hand, the workshops are free, or the learners
are only paying a token amount (to cut the no-show rate), then your
actual product may be some mix of:

- your grant proposals,

- the alumni of your workshops that the companies sponsoring you would
  like to hire,

- the half page summary of your work in the mayor's annual report to
  city council that shows how she's supporting the local tech sector,
  or

- the personal satisfaction that your volunteer instructors get from
  teaching.

As with the lesson design process in [s:process](#CHAPTER), you should
try to create personas to describe people who might be interested in
what you're doing and figure out which of their needs your program
will meet. You should also write a set of [elevator
pitches](#g:elevator-pitch), each aimed at a different potential
stakeholder. A widely-used template for these pitches looks like this:

1. For *target audience*

1. who *dissatisfaction with what's currently available*

1. our *category*

1. provide *key benefit*.

1. Unlike *alternatives*

1. our program *key distinguishing feature.*

Continuing with the weekend workshop example, we could use this pitch
for participants:

> For *people re-entering the workforce after taking time out to raise
> children* who *still have regular childcare responsibilities*, our
> *introductory programming workshops* provide *weekend classes with
> on-site childcare*. Unlike *online classes*, our program *gives
> participants a chance to meet people who are at the same stage of
> life*.

but this one for companies that we want to donate staff time for
teaching:

> For *a company that wants to recruit entry-level software developers*
> that *is struggling to find mature, diverse candidates* our
> *introductory programming workshops* provide *a pool of potential
> recruits in their thirties that includes large numbers of people from
> underrepresented groups*. Unlike *college recruiting fairs*, our
> program *connects companies directly with a diverse audience*.

If you don't know why different potential stakeholders might be
interested in what you're doing, ask them. If you do know, ask them
anyway: answers can change over time, and it's a good way to discover
things that you might have missed.

Once you have written these pitches, you should use them to drive what
you put on your organization's web site and in other publicity material,
since it will help people figure out as quickly as possible whether you
and they have something to talk about. (You probably *shouldn't* copy
them verbatim, since many people in tech have seen this template so
often that their eyes will glaze over if they encounter it again.)

As you are writing these pitches, remember that people are not just
economic animals. A sense of accomplishment, control over their own
lives, and being part of a community motivates them just as much as
money. People may volunteer to teach with you because their friends are
doing it; similarly, a company may say that they're sponsoring classes
for economically disadvantaged high school students because they want a
larger pool of potential employees further down the road, but the CEO
might actually be doing it simply because it's the right thing to do.

## Branding and Positioning {#s:marketing-branding}

A [brand](#g:brand) is someone's first reaction to a mention
of a product; if the reaction is "what's that?", you don't have a brand
yet. Branding is important because people aren't going to help with
something they don't know about or don't care about.

Most discussion of branding today focuses on ways to build awareness
online. Mailing lists, blogs, and Twitter all give you ways to reach
people, but as the volume of (mis)information steadily increases, the
attention people pay to each interruption decreases. As this happens,
[positioning](#g:positioning) becomes more important.
Sometimes called "differentiation", it is what sets your offering apart
from others, i.e., it's the "unlike" section of your elevator pitches.
When you reach out to people who are already familiar with your field,
you should emphasize your positioning, since it's what will catch their
attention.

There are other things you can do to help build your brand. One is to
use props: a robot car that one of your students made from scraps she
found around the house, the website another student made for his
parents' retirement home, or anything else that makes what you're
doing seem real. Another is to make a short video---no more than a few
minutes long---showcasing the backgrounds and accomplishments of your
students. The aim of both is to tell a story: while people always ask
for data, stories are what they believe.

Notice, though that these examples assume people have access to the
money, materials, and/or technology needed to create these products.
Many don't---in fact, those serving economically disadvantaged groups
almost certainly don't. As Rosario Robinson says, "Free works for those
that can afford free." In those situations, stories become even more
important, because they can be shared and re-shared without limit.

> One of the most compelling stories a person or organization can tell

> someone had taught you but didn't? Was there one particular person you
> wanted to help, and that opened the floodgates? If there isn't a
> section on your website starting, "Once upon a time," think about
> adding one.

Whatever else you do, make your organization findable in online
searches: [[DiSa2014b](#CITE)] discovered that the search terms parents
were likely to use for out-of-school computing classes didn't actually
find those classes. There's a lot of folklore about how to make things
findable under the label "SEO" (for "search engine optimization"); given
Google's near-monopoly powers and lack of transparency, most of it boils
down to trying to stay one step ahead of algorithms designed to prevent
people from gaming rankings.

Unless you're very well funded, the best you can do is to search for
yourself and your organization on a regular basis and see what comes
up, then read [these guidelines from Moz][moz-guidelines] and do what
you can to improve your site. Keep [this cartoon][xkcd-org-chart] in
mind: people don't (initially) want to know about your org chart or
get a virtual tour of your site; they want your address, parking
information, and above all, some idea of what you teach, when you
teach it, how to get in touch, and how it's going to change their
life.

Offline findability is equally important for new organizations. Many of
the people you hope to reach might not be online as often as you, and
some won't be online at all. Notice boards in schools, local libraries,
drop-in centers, and grocery stores are still an effective way to reach
them.

> add something to your website to help the next person find what they
> need. The organizations you are helping will soon start to help you in
> return.

## The Art of the Cold Call {#s:marketing-cold-call}

Building a web site and hoping that people find it is one thing; calling
people up or knocking on their door without any sort of prior
introduction is another. As with standing up and teaching, though, it's
a craft that can be learned like any other, and there are a few simple
rules you can follow:

Establish a point of connection
: such as "I was speaking to X" or "You attended bootcamp Y". This
  must be specific: spammers and headhunters have trained us all to
  ignore anything that starts, "I recently read your website".

Create a slight sense of urgency
: by saying something like, "We're booking workshops right now." Be
  cautious with this, though; as with the previous recommendation, the
  web's race to the bottom has conditioned people to discount anything
  that sounds like a hustle.

Explain how you are going to help make their lives better.
: A pitch like "Your students will be able to do their math homework
  much faster if you let us tutor them" is a good attention-getter.

Be specific about what you are offering.
: "Our usual two-day curriculum includes..." helpers
  listeners figure out right away whether a conversation is worth
  pursuing.

Make yourself credible
: by mentioning your backers, your size, how long you've been around,
  or your instructors's backgrounds.

Tell them what your terms are.
: Do you charge money? Do they need to cover instructors' travel
  costs? Can they reserve seats for their own staff?

Write a good subject line.
: Keep it short, avoid ALL CAPS, words like "sale" or "free" (which
  increase the odds that your message will be treated as spam), and
  never! use! exclamation! marks!

Keep it short,
: since the purest form of respect is to treat other people as if
  their time was as valuable as your own.

The email template below puts all of these points in action. It has
worked pretty well: we found that about half of emails were answered,
about half of those wanted to talk more, and about half of those led to
workshops, which means that 10--15% of targeted emails turned into
workshops. That's much better than the 2--3% response rate most
organizations expect with cold calls, but can still be pretty
demoralizing if you're not used to it.

## A Final Thought {#s:marketing-final}

As [[Kuch2011](#CITE)] says, if you can't be first in a category, create
a new category that you can be first in; if you can't do that, join an
existing group or think about doing something else entirely. This isn't
defeatist: if someone else is already doing what you're doing better
than you, there are probably lots of other equally useful things you
could be doing instead.

## Exercises {#s:marketing-exercises}

### Write an Elevator Pitch for a City Councillor (individual/10)

This chapter described an organization that offers weekend programming
workshops for people re-entering the workforce after taking a break to
raise children. Write an elevator pitch for that organization aimed at a
city councillor whose support the organization needs.

### Write Elevator Pitches for Your Organization (individual/30)

Identify two groups of people your organization needs support from, and
write an elevator pitch aimed at each one.

### Email Subjects (pairs/10)

Write the subject lines (and only the subject lines) for three email
messages: one announcing a new course, one announcing a new sponsor, and
one announcing a change in project leadership. Compare your subject
lines to a partner's and see if you can merge the best features of each
while also shortening them.

### Identify Causes of Passive Resistance (small groups/30)

People who don't want change will sometimes say so out loud, but will
also often use various forms of passive resistance, such as just not
getting around to it over and over again, or raising one possible
problem after another to make the change seem riskier and more expensive
than it's actually likely to be. Working in small groups, list three or
four reasons why people might not want your teaching initiative to go
ahead, and explain what you can do with the time and resources you have
to counteract each.

### Why Learn to Program? (individual/15)

Revisit the "Why Learn to Program?" exercise in
[s:intro-exercises](#SECTION). Where do your reasons for teaching and
your learners' reasons for learning align? Where are they not aligned?
How does that affect your marketing?

### Appealing to Your Learners (think-pair-share/15)

Adult learners are different from children and teens: in general, they
are better at managing their time, they're learning because they want to
or need to, and they bring a lot of previous experience of learning into
the room, so they tend to be better at knowing when they're struggling
productively and when they're just struggling.

Working in pairs, write a one-paragraph pitch for a class on web design
that touches on these points, and then compare your pair's pitch with
those of other pairs.

### Conversational Programmers (think-pair-share/15)

A [conversational programmer](#g:conversational-programmer)
is someone who needs to know enough about computing to have a meaningful
conversation with a programmer, but isn't going to program themselves.
[[Wang2018](#CITE)] found that most learning resources don't address this
group's needs. Working in pairs, write a pitch for a half-day workshop
intended to help people that fit this description, and then share your
pair's pitch with the rest of the class.
