<h1 id="s:joining">C) Joining Our Community</h1>
<p>This appendix describes how you can become part of our community by using, sharing, and improving this material.</p>
<h2 id="s:joining-covenant">C.1) Contributor Covenant</h2>
<p>The contributor covenant laid out below governs contributions to this book. It is adapted from the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org">Contributor Covenant</a> version 1.4; please see <a href="./conduct.html">Appendix D</a> for a sample code of conduct for use in classes and other learning situations.</p>
<h3 id="our-pledge" class="unnumbered">Our Pledge</h3>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>
<h3 id="our-standards" class="unnumbered">Our Standards</h3>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="our-responsibilities" class="unnumbered">Our Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this covenant, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<h3 id="scope" class="unnumbered">Scope</h3>
<p>This covenant applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
<h3 id="enforcement" class="unnumbered">Enforcement</h3>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [gvwilson@third-bit.com](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
<p>Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the covenant in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.</p>
<h2 id="s:joining-using">C.2) Using This Material</h2>
<p>This material has been used in many ways, from a multi-week online class to an intensive in-person workshop. It’s usually possible to cover large parts of Chapters <a href="#s:models" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="s:models">[s:models]</a>–<a href="#s:process" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="s:process">[s:process]</a>, <a href="./performance.html">Chapter 8</a>, and <a href="./motivation.html">Chapter 10</a> in two long days.</p>
<h3 id="in-person" class="unnumbered">In Person</h3>
<p>This is the most effective way to deliver this training, but also the most demanding. Participants are physically together. When they need to practice teaching in small groups, some or all of them go to nearby breakout spaces. Participants use their own tablets or laptops to view online material during the class and for shared note-taking (<a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-notetaking">Section 9.7</a>), and use pen and paper or whiteboards for other exercises. Questions and discussion are done aloud.</p>
<p>If you are teaching in this format, you should use sticky notes as status flags so that you can see who needs help, who has questions, and who’s ready to move on (<a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-status-flags">Section 9.8.1</a>). You should also use them to distribute attention so that everyone gets a fair share of the instructor’s time (<a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-attention">Section 9.8.2</a>), and as minute cards to encourage learners to reflect on what they’ve just learned and to give you actionable feedback while you still have time to act on it (<a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-minute-cards">Section 9.8.3</a>).</p>
<h3 id="online-in-groups" class="unnumbered">Online in Groups</h3>
<p>In this format, 10–40 learners are together in 2–6 groups of 4–12, but those groups are geographically distributed. Each group uses one camera and microphone to connect to the video call, rather than each person being on the call separately. We have found that having good audio matters more than having good video, and that the better the audio, the more learners can communicate with the instructor and other rooms by voice rather than via text online.</p>
<p>The entire class does shared note-taking together, and also uses the shared notes for asking and answering questions. (Having several dozen people try to talk on a call works poorly, so in most sessions, the instructor does the talking and learners respond through the note-taking tool’s chat.)</p>
<h3 id="online-as-individuals" class="unnumbered">Online as Individuals</h3>
<p>The natural extension of being online in groups is to be online as individuals. As with online groups, the instructor will do most of the talking and learners will mostly participate via text chat. Good audio is once again more important than good video, and participants should use text chat to signal that they want to speak next (<a href="./meetings.html">Appendix F</a>).</p>
<p>Having participants online individually makes it more difficult to draw and share concept maps (<a href="./memory.html#s:memory-exercises">Section 3.5</a>) or give feedback on teaching (<a href="./performance.html#s:performance-exercises">Section 8.5</a>). Instructors should therefore rely more on exercises with written results that can be put in the shared notes, such as giving feedback on stock videos of people teaching.</p>
<h3 id="multi-week-online" class="unnumbered">Multi-Week Online</h3>
<p>This was the first format used, and I no longer recommend it: while spreading the class out gives people time to reflect and tackle larger exercises, it also greatly increases the odds that they’ll have to drop out because of other demands on their time.</p>
<p>The class meets every week for an hour via video conferencing. Each meeting may be held twice to accommodate learners’ time zones and schedules. Participants use shared note-taking as described above for online group classes, post homework online between classes, and comment on each other’s work. (In practice, comments are relatively rare: people strongly prefer to discuss material in the weekly meetings.)</p>

<h3 id="a-teaching-commons" class="unnumbered">A Teaching Commons</h3>
<p><a href="./community.html#s:community-governance">Section 13.4</a> defined a commons as something managed jointly by a community according to rules they themselves have evolved and adopted. Open source software and Wikipedia are both successful examples; the question is, why don’t teachers build lessons collaboratively in the same way? People have proposed <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2016/why-secondary-teachers-dont-want-a-github-for-lesson-plans/">a variety of reasons</a>, but I don’t think any of them hold up to close scrutiny:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The most important thing about a lesson isn’t having it, but writing it, because that gives you a chance to figure out what you think about the topic.</dt>
<dd><p>The same is true of software, and yet most programmers use and improve libraries rather than building everything from scratch.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It’s always easier in the short term to write something from scratch than to learn your way around someone else’s material.</dt>
<dd><p>And yet most teachers use textbooks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It doesn’t pay off for most teachers because they only teach any particular lesson once a year (or once a quarter).</dt>
<dd><p>Infrequent teaching ought to push people <em>toward</em> re-use, not away from it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Working at scale results in a more neutral point of view, but in many fields, lessons are valuable precisely because they’re one person’s opinion.</dt>
<dd><p>There is no reason why there couldn’t be half a dozen different shared lessons on a topic, each approaching the subject from a particular viewpoint, just as there are often several software libraries that fill the same basic need in different ways.</p>
</dd>
<dt>There’s no onboarding process to teach people the mechanics.</dt>
<dd><p>This is undoubtedly a factor, but hasn’t stopped Wikipedia.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Collaboration on lesson development gets squeezed out by more important things.</dt>
<dd><p>In other words, we’re too busy to save time?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Schools’ firewalls prevents people from working on shared materials.</dt>
<dd><p>This is true for some teachers, but not for all, and most teachers in industrialized countries have access to a computer at home these days.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Schools’ policies prevents people from using or contributing to shared materials.</dt>
<dd><p>Again, this is true for some teachers, but not for all.</p>
</dd>
<dt>There’s no way to measure the benefit, so there’s no incentive to do it.</dt>
<dd><p>It’s hard to measure the benefits of open source software and Wikipedia contributions as well, and yet they have done well.</p>
</dd>
<dt>It’s a generational thing: as digital natives, tomorrow’s teachers will just naturally do it.</dt>
<dd><p>Possibly, but advocates of revolutionary socialism and the Dvorak keyboard have been making similar claims about “eventually” for years.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> is proof by implementation that a teaching commons can produce and maintain high-quality lessons that hundreds of people can use [<a href="./bib.html#Wils2016">Wils2016</a>]. I hope you will choose to help us do the same for this book. If you are new to working this way:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Start small.</dt>
<dd><p>Fix a typo, clarify the wording of an exercise, correct or update a citation, or suggest a better example or analogy to illustrate some point.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Join the conversation.</dt>
<dd><p>Have a look at the issues and proposed changes that other people have already filed and add your comments to them. It’s often possible to improve improvements, and it’s a good way to introduce yourself to the community and make new friends. (To make this as easy as possible, we tag some issues and proposed changes as “Suitable for Newcomers” or “Help Wanted”.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Discuss, then edit.</dt>
<dd><p>If you want to propose a large change, such as reorganizing or splitting an entire chapter, please file an issue that outlines your proposal and your reasoning and tag it with “Proposal”. We encourage everyone to add comments to these issues so that the whole discussion of what and why is in the open and can be archived. If the proposal is accepted, the actual work may then be broken down into several smaller issues or changes that can be tackled independently.</p>
