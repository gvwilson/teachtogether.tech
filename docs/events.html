<h1 id="s:events">I) Checklists for Events</h1>
<p>[<a href="./bib.html#Gawa2007">Gawa2007</a>] popularized the idea that using checklists can save lives (and make many other things better too). The results of recent studies have been more nuanced [<a href="./bib.html#Avel2013">Avel2013</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Urba2014">Urba2014</a>], but we still find them useful, particularly when bringing new instructors onto a team.</p>
<p>The checklists below are used before, during, and after instructor training events, and can easily be adapted for end-learner workshops as well. We recommend that every group build and maintain its own checklists customized for its instructors’ and learners’ needs.</p>
