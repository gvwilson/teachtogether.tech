</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first task in teaching is to figure out who your learners are and what they already know. Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia Benner, who studied how nurses progress from being novices to being experts [<a href="./bib.html#Benn2000">Benn2000</a>]. Benner identified five stages of cognitive development that most people go through in a fairly consistent way. (We say “most” and “fairly” because human beings are highly variable; obsessing over how a few geniuses taught or learned isn’t generally useful.)</p>
<p>For our purposes, we can simplify Benner’s progression to three stages:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:novice"><strong>Novices</strong></a></dt>
<dd><p>don’t know what they don’t know, i.e., they don’t yet have a usable mental model of the problem domain. As a result, they reason by analogy and guesswork, borrowing bits and pieces of mental models from other domains that seem superficially similar.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:competent-practitioner"><strong>Competent practitioners</strong></a></dt>
<dd><p>can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances because they have a mental model that’s good enough for everyday purposes. That model doesn’t have to be complete or accurate, just useful.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:expert"><strong>Experts</strong></a></dt>
<dd><p>have mental models that include the complexities and special cases that competent practitioners’ do not. This allows experts to handle situations that are out of the ordinary, diagnose the causes of problems, and so on. Like competent practitioners, experts know what they don’t know and how to learn it; we will discuss expertise in more detail in <a href="./memory.html">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what <em>is</em> a <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:mental-model"><strong>mental model</strong></a>? As you may have gathered from the way we used the term above, it is a simplified representation of the most important parts of some problem domain that is good enough to enable problem solving. One example is the ball-and-spring models of molecules used in high school chemistry. Atoms aren’t actually balls, and their bonds aren’t actually springs, but the model does a good job of helping people reason about chemical compounds and their reactions. A more sophisticated model of an atom has a small central ball (the nucleus) surrounded by orbiting electrons. Again, it’s wrong, but useful.</p>
<p>One sign that someone is a novice is that the things they say are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong</a>, e.g., they think there’s a difference between programs they type in character by character and identical ones that they have copied and pasted. As <a href="./motivation.html">Chapter 10</a> explains, it is very important not to make novices uncomfortable for doing this: until they have a better mental model, reasoning by (inappropriate) borrowing from their knowledge of other subjects is the best they can do.</p>
<p>Presenting novices with a pile of facts is counter-productive, because they don’t yet have a model to fit those facts into. In fact, presenting too many facts too soon can actually reinforce the incorrect mental model they’ve cobbled together—as [<a href="./bib.html#Mull2007a">Mull2007a</a>] observed in a study of video instruction for science students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Students have existing ideas about<span>…</span>phenomena before viewing a video. If the video presents<span>…</span>concepts in a clear, well illustrated way, students believe they are learning but they do not engage with the media on a deep enough level to realize that what was is presented differs from their prior knowledge<span>…</span> There is hope, however. Presenting students’ common misconceptions in a video alongside the<span>…</span>concepts has been shown to increase learning by increasing the amount of mental effort students expend while watching it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your goal when teaching novices should therefore be <em>to help them construct a mental model</em> so that they have somewhere to put facts. For example, Software Carpentry’s <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">lesson on the Unix shell</a> introduces fifteen commands in three hours. That’s one command every twelve minutes, which seems glacially slow until you realize that the lesson’s real purpose isn’t to teach those fifteen commands: it’s to teach paths, history, tab completion, wildcards, pipes, command-line arguments, and redirection. Until novices understand those concepts, the commands don’t make sense; once they do understand those concepts, they can quickly assemble a repertoire of commands.</p>
<p>The cognitive differences between novices and competent practitioners underpin the differences between two kinds of teaching materials. A tutorial’s purpose is to help newcomers to a field build a mental model; a manual’s role, on the other hand, is to help competent practitioners fill in the gaps in their knowledge. Tutorials frustrate competent practitioners because they move too slowly and say things that are obvious (though they are anything <em>but</em> obvious to novices). Equally, manuals frustrate novices because they use jargon and <em>don’t</em> explain things. This phenomenon is called the <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:expertise-reversal"><strong>expertise reversal effect</strong></a> [<a href="./bib.html#Kaly2003">Kaly2003</a>], and is another reason you have to decide early on who your lessons are meant for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Handful of Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>One of the reasons Unix and C became popular is that Kernighan et al’s trilogy [<a href="./bib.html#Kern1978">Kern1978</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Kern1983">Kern1983</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Kern1988">Kern1988</a>] somehow managed to be good tutorials <em>and</em> good manuals at the same time. Ray and Ray’s book on Unix [<a href="./bib.html#Ray2014">Ray2014</a>] and Fehily’s introduction to SQL [<a href="./bib.html#Fehi2008">Fehi2008</a>] are among the very few other books in computing that have accomplished this; even after re-reading them several times, I don’t know how they manage to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="s:models-formative-assessment">2.1) Are People Learning?</h2>
<p>One of the exercises in building a mental model is to clear away things that <em>don’t</em> belong. As Mark Twain said, “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” Broadly speaking, novices’ misconceptions fall into three categories:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Factual errors</dt>
<dd><p>like believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia (it’s Victoria). These are simple to correct, but getting the facts right is not enough on its own.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Broken models</dt>
<dd><p>like believing that motion and acceleration must be in the same direction. We can address these by having novices reason through examples that draw attention to contradictions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fundamental beliefs</dt>
<dd><p>such as “the world is only a few thousand years old” or “some kinds of people are just naturally better at programming than others” [<a href="./bib.html#Guzd2015b">Guzd2015b</a>,<a href="./bib.html#Pati2016">Pati2016</a>]. These are also broken models, but often deeply connected to the learner’s social identity, so they resist evidence and reason.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Teaching is most effective when teachers identify and clear up learners’ misconceptions <em>during the lesson</em>. This is called <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:formative-assessment"><strong>formative assessment</strong></a>; the word “formative” means it is used to form or shape the teaching. Learners don’t pass or fail formative assessment; instead, it tells the teacher and the learner how they are both doing and what they should focus on next. For example, a music teacher might ask a learner to play a scale very slowly in order to see if she is breathing correctly, while someone teaching web design could ask a learner to resize the images in a page to check if his explanation of CSS made sense.</p>
<p>The counterpoint to formative assessment is <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:summative-assessment"><strong>summative assessment</strong></a>, which you do at the end of the lesson to determine if your teaching was successful, i.e., whether the learner has understood what you have taught and is ready to move on. One way of thinking about the difference is that a chef tasting food as she cooks it is formative assessments, but the guests tasting it once it’s served is summative.</p>
<p>In order to be useful during teaching, a formative assessment has to be quick to administer (so that it doesn’t break the flow of the lesson) and give a clear result (so that it can be used with groups as well as individuals). The most widely used kind of formative assessment is probably the multiple choice question (MCQ). A lot of teachers have a low opinion of them, but when they are designed well, they can reveal much more than just whether someone knows specific facts. For example, suppose you are teaching children how to do multi-digit addition [<a href="./bib.html#Ojos2015">Ojos2015</a>], and you give them this MCQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 37 + 15?<br />
a) 52<br />
b) 42<br />
c) 412<br />
d) 43</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correct answer is 52, but the other answers provide valuable insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the child chooses 42, she is throwing away the carry completely.</li>
<li>If she chooses 412, she is treating each column of numbers as a separate problem unconnected to its neighbors.</li>
<li>If she chooses 43 then she knows she has to carry the 1, but is carrying it back into the column it came from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these incorrect answers is a <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:plausible-distractor"><strong>plausible distractor</strong></a> with <a class="glossref" href="./gloss.html#g:diagnostic-power"><strong>diagnostic power</strong></a>. A distractor is a wrong or less-than-best answer; “plausible” means that it looks like it could be right, while “diagnostic power” means that each of the distractors helps us figure out what to explain next to that particular learner.</p>
<p>In order to come up with plausible distractors, think about the questions your learners asked or problems they had the last time you taught this subject. If you haven’t taught it before, think about your own misconceptions, ask colleagues about their experiences, or look at the history of your field—if everyone misunderstood your subject in some way fifty years ago, the odds are that a lot of your learners will still misunderstand it that way today. You can also ask open-ended questions in class to collect misconceptions about material to be covered in a later class, or check question and answer sites like <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> to see what people learning the subject elsewhere are confused by.</p>
<p>MCQs aren’t the only kind of formative assessment you can use: Parsons Problems (<a href="./load.html">Chapter 4</a>) and matching problems (<a href="./exercises.html#s:exercises-diagrams">Section 12.3</a>) are also quick and unambiguous. Short-answer questions are another option: if answers are 2–5 words long, there are few enough plausible answers to make scalable assessment possible [<a href="./bib.html#Mill2016a">Mill2016a</a>].</p>
<p>Developing formative assessment is useful even if you don’t use them in class because it forces you to think about your learners’ mental models and how they might be broken—in short, to put yourself into your learners’ heads and see the topic from their point of view. Whatever you pick, you should use something that takes a minute or two every 10–15 minutes to make sure that your learners are actually learning. That way, if a significant number of people have fallen behind, only a short portion of the lesson will have to be repeated. This rhythm isn’t based on an intrinsic attentional limit: [<a href="./bib.html#Wils2007">Wils2007</a>] found little support for the often-repeated claim that students can only pay attention for 10–15 minutes. If you are teaching online (<a href="./online.html">Chapter 11</a>), you should check in much more often to keep learners engaged.</p>
<p>Formative assessments can also be used preemptively: if you start a class with an MCQ and everyone answers it correctly, you can skip the part of the lecture that was going to explain something your learners already know. Doing this also shows learners that you respect your learners’ time enough not to waste it, which helps with motivation (<a href="./motivation.html">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<p>If the majority of the class chooses the same wrong answer, you should go back and work on correcting the misconception that distractor points to. If their answers are pretty evenly split between several options they are probably just guessing, so you should back up and re-explain the idea in a different way.</p>
<p>What if most of the class votes for the right answer, but a few vote for wrong ones? In that case, you have to decide whether you should spend time getting the minority caught up, or whether it’s more important to keep the majority engaged. No matter how hard you work or what teaching practices you use, you won’t always be able to give everyone what they need; it’s your responsibility as a teacher to make the call.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concept Inventories</strong></p>
<p>Given enough data, MCQs can be made surprisingly precise. The best-known example is the Force Concept Inventory [<a href="./bib.html#Hest1992">Hest1992</a>], which assesses understanding of basic Newtonian mechanics. By interviewing a large number of respondents, correlating their misconceptions with patterns of right and wrong answers, and then improving the questions, its creators constructed a diagnostic tool that can pinpoint specific misconceptions. Researchers can then use that tool to measure how effective changes in teaching methods are [<a href="./bib.html#Hake1998">Hake1998</a>].</p>
<p>Tew and others developed and validated a language-independent assessment for introductory programming [<a href="./bib.html#Tew2011">Tew2011</a>]; [<a href="./bib.html#Park2016">Park2016</a>] has replicated it, and [<a href="./bib.html#Hamo2017">Hamo2017</a>] is developing a concept inventory for recursion. However, it’s very costly to build tools like this, and students’ ability to search for answers online is an ever-increasing threat to their validity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working formative assessments into class requires only a little bit of preparation and practice. Giving students colored or numbered cards so that they can call answer an MCQ at once (rather than holding up their hands in turn), having one of the options be, “I have no idea”, and encouraging them to talk to their neighbors for a few seconds before answering will all help ensure that your teaching flow isn’t disrupted. <a href="./classroom.html#s:classroom-peer">Section 9.2</a> describes a powerful, evidence-based teaching method that builds on these simple ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Humor</strong></p>
<p>Teachers sometimes put supposedly-silly answers like “my nose!” on MCQs, particularly ones intended for younger students. However, they don’t provide any insight into learners’ misconceptions, and most people don’t actually find them funny (especially on re-reading).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lesson’s formative assessments should prepare learners for its summative assessment: no one should ever encounter a question on an exam that the teaching did not prepare them for. This doesn’t mean you should never put new kinds of problems on an exam, but if you do, you should have given learners practice with (and feedback on) tackling novel problems beforehand.</p>

<p>What is one mental model you use to understand your work? Write a few sentences describing it, and give feedback on a partner’s. Once you have done that, have a few people share their models with the whole group. Does everyone agree on what a mental model is? Is it possible to give a precise definition, or is the concept useful precisely because it is a bit fuzzy?</p>

<h3 id="other-kinds-of-formative-assessment-whole-class20-minutes" class="unnumbered">Other Kinds of Formative Assessment (<span>whole class</span>/<span>20</span> minutes)</h3>
<p>A good formative assessment requires people to think through a problem. For example, imagine that you have placed a block of ice in a bathtub and then filled the tub to the rim with water. When the ice melts, does the water level go up (so that the tub overflows), go down, or stay the same (<a href="./models.html#f:models-bathtub">Figure 2.1</a>)?</p>

<figure>
<img src="./fig/bathtub.png" alt="Figure 2.1: Ice in a Bathtub" /><figcaption id="f:models-bathtub">Figure 2.1: Ice in a Bathtub</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The correct answer is that the level stays the same: the ice displaces its own weight in water, so it exactly fills the “hole” it has made when it melts. Figuring out why helps people build a model of the relationship between weight, volume, and density [<a href="./bib.html#Epst2002">Epst2002</a>].</p>
<p>Describe another kind of formative assessment you have seen or used and explain how it helps both the instructor and the learner figure out where they are and what they need to do next.</p>

<p>The model of skill development described at the start of this chapter is sometimes called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model</a>. Another commonly-used progression is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence">four stages of competence</a>:</p>
<dl>
