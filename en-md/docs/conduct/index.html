<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.</p>
<h2>Our Standards</h2>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive
environment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>using welcoming and inclusive language,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gracefully accepting constructive criticism,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focusing on what is best for the community, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>showing empathy towards other community members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
attention or advances,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
attacks,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>public or private harassment,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
electronic address, without explicit permission, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
a professional setting</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its
community. Examples of representing a project or community include
using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further
defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by emailing the project's maintainer at <code>gvwilson@third-bit.com</code>.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
<p>Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as
determined by other members of the project's leadership.</p>
<h2>Attribution</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from
the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org">Contributor Covenant</a> version 1.4.</p>
